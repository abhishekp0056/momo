    <h1>I Miss You
       <ol> MOMO </ol>
       <ol> JAYA PANDEY (mera billu) </ol>
       </h1>
    <p>Every moment without you feels like forever. I love how you care for me , our nights out, quiet moments together, getting ready for special occasions, and the little romantic gestures like giving you flowers. Here are some memories that keep me going until we’re together again.
        I WOLF YOU MOMO

        Yours eyes are deep like an  ocean although I don’t know how to swim but i want to dive into your lovely eyes 
        There are 7 billion smiles in this world and i just wanna see yours whole day and night 
        When I look at the sun or the moon
        and listen to the birds in the air
        I can't help but think of you how you light up the dark and the day,
        how even the smell of you makes flowers bloom
        When i see your smiling all my pain gets away 
        I love you bby and I don’t wanna lose you ever you are the part of life and no matter what happens i will stay by your side in your lowest i will be there in your highest i will be there i will be there all the time when ever you want me we will grow together support each other we will encourage each other
